          Mission
        </h2>
        <p>
          The mission of the Merchant Business Group (“Merchant BG”) is to
          improve the Web for people and organisations that sell goods or
          services, or accept donations online. This includes both
          business-to-business (B2B) merchants, business-to-consumer (B2C)
          merchants as well as not-for-profit donation acceptors. In this
          non-technical forum, participants will discuss merchant challenges,
          how emerging Web technologies could help address them, and what
          additional Web capabilities may be necessary. Likely topics include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Customer interaction, capture and retention via accessible
          immersive Web experiences.
          </li>
          <li>Web checkout experiences, including the value merchants should
          gain with W3C's Web payments standards;
          </li>
          <li>Emerging regulatory requirements (e.g., related to privacy or
          accessibility) and ensuring good customer experience;
          </li>
          <li>The evolution of Web advertising;
          </li>
          <li>Good practices for reducing online fraud;
          </li>
          <li>Enhancements to transaction integrity and assurance;
          </li>
          <li>Improving mobile Web commerce experiences.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          Participants will choose and prioritize discussion topics.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Activities in Scope
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Education about Web technology trends and the impact on
          merchants, including through discussions with other W3C groups. These
          activities will include <a href="#non-technical">non-technical</a>
          briefings.
          </li>
          <li>Identification of current merchant challenges, best practices for
          addressing them, and how those practices may change for various
          reasons (e.g., due to evolving privacy practices).
          </li>
          <li>Communication of merchant use cases and requirements to groups
          within and outside W3C.
          </li>
          <li>Coordinating reviews of the work of other W3C groups (e.g., the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/">Web Payments Working
          Group</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/Webauthn/">Web Authentication
          Working Group</a> or <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/immersive-web/">Immersive Web Working Group</a>).
          It is a goal that this group enable high-bandwidth, two-way
          communication channels with other W3C groups.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Activities out of Scope
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Development of technical specifications.
          </li>
          <li>Discussion of specific products or implementations consistent
          with W3C's <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2017/antitrust-guidance">Antitrust
          and Competition Guidance</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="deliverables">
          Deliverables
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Merchant Business Group may publish use cases, requirements,
          analyses, white papers or other deliverables consistent with the
          scope of this charter. These may be shared with other W3C groups as
          input to standardization activities, as well as groups outside W3C.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group will not publish technical Specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Published documents should represent group consensus. Documents will
          be published under the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/doc-license">W3C Document
          License</a> and will be freely available.

        <h2 id="participation">
          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          Although the group focuses on merchant issues, participation is not
          limited to merchants. Integrators and others who represent merchant
          interests are also encouraged to participate and contribute diverse
          perspectives. We also seek global participation.
        </p>
        <p id="non-technical">
          Participants should have knowledge of industry business requirements
          and some technical knowledge. Deep technical knowledge is not
          required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participation will potentially involve email, teleconferences,
          authoring of use cases, and review of education materials. These
          activities are expected to require approximately 4 hours monthly.
          Participants are also encouraged to accelerate progress by sharing
          materials such as externally developed use cases and requirements, or
          experimental results.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group should also hold at least one face-to-face meeting per
          year. The group will determine the location, which may include W3C's
          TPAC event or co-located with another industry event.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of Ethics
          and Professional Conduct</a> applies to participation in this group.

        <h2>
          Process
        </h2>
        <p>
          The group operates under the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and
          Business Group Process</a>. Terms in this Charter that conflict with
          those of the Community and Business Group Process are void.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group will publish minutes or summaries of its meetings.
        </p>
        <h3 id="decision">
          Decision Process
        </h3>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. For
          important decisions, the Chairs will issue a Call for Consensus to
          allow multi-day online feedback for a proposed course of action, and
          publicly record the outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process
          is fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably
          favour or discriminate against any group participant or their
          employer.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Chair Selection
        </h3>
        <p>
          Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace
          their Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However,
          if 5 participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an
          election, the group must use the following process to replace any
          current Chair(s) with a new Chair, consulting the Community
          Development Lead on election operations (e.g., voting infrastructure
          and using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777">RFC
          2777</a>).
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14
          days to announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as
          all participants have announced their intentions. If there is only
          one candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or
          more candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
          </li>
          <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
          candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have
          voted. The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the
          same organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is
          used to break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
          Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development
          Lead, after evaluating the election, may take any action including no
          action.
        </p>
        <h3 id="charter-change">
          Amendments to this Charter
        </h3>
        <p>
          The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing
          the text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described
          above. The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made
          by conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new
          charter, if approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the
          charter itself, or 7 days after the result of the election is
          announced, whichever is later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the
          votes cast in the approval vote to pass. The group may make simple
          corrections to the charter such as deliverable dates by the simpler
          group decision process rather than this charter amendment process.
          The group will use the amendment process for any substantive changes
          to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision process or rules for
          amending the charter.
